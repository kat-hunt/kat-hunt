### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Kat Hunt. I am a senior in Aerospace Engineering, which is exciting. I felt like it was never going to happen, but here we are. #WootWoot
I am a member of Air Force ROTC, so at the end of this academic year I will be commissioning as an officer into the United States Air Force.

During Aer E 361, I am excited to learn the C language. I know the basics of C++ from a different class and really enjoyed that language. I am also interested to learn more about Git and GitHub. My first interaction with GitHub was a little rocky, but has been improving ever since. Hopefully this trend continues throughout the rest of the course.   

My hobbies include eating, sleeping, and hiking. I absolutely love all food and you can usually find me carrying around a box of something with me. I make it a personal goal to always have food on me becuase I am usually hungry all the time. I am a big advocate of sleep and I usually get a lot of it. Sleep is a big priority of mine so I aim to get atleast 8 hours every night. During my time in college, I developed the ability to fall asleep wherever. I like to call it my superpower... ðŸ˜Ž Also during my time at Iowa State, I developed a love for hiking and being in nature. So far, my favorite hike that I've been on was on the Tennessee-South Carolina border on the Appalachain Trail. The trail was in the Smokey Mountains so there were times when the "smoke" was surrounding you. 10/10 highly recommend this trail.
